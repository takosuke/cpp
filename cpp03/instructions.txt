Chapter II: General rules

Compiling

    Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

    Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98.

Formatting and naming conventions

    The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ..., exn.

    Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in the guidelines.

    Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will always be named according to the class name (e.g., ClassName.hpp, ClassName.cpp).

    Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character and be displayed to the standard output.

    No coding style is enforced (Goodbye Norminette!), but code must be clean and readable for peer evaluators.

Allowed/Forbidden

    You are encouraged to use C++ versions of C functions from the standard library.

    Forbidden: External libraries (including C++11 and Boost), *printf(), *alloc(), and free().

    Forbidden: The using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords (unless explicitly stated), and the STL (Containers/Algorithms) until Modules 08 and 09.

Design requirements

    Avoid memory leaks when using new.

    Classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form.

    No function implementations in header files (except for templates).

    Headers must use include guards and include all necessary dependencies.

Chapter IV: Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

    Turn-in directory: ex00/

    Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, ClapTrap.{h, hpp}, ClapTrap.cpp

    Forbidden functions: None 

Implement a class named ClapTrap with the following private attributes:

    Name: Passed to the constructor.

    Hit points: 10.

    Energy points: 10.

    Attack damage: 0.

Public member functions:

    void attack(const std::string& target);

    void takeDamage(unsigned int amount);

    void beRepaired(unsigned int amount); 

Rules:

    Attacking and repairing cost 1 energy point.

    ClapTrap cannot act if it has 0 hit points or energy points.

    All member functions, constructors, and destructors must print descriptive messages to the console.

Chapter V: Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

    Turn-in directory: ex01/

    Files to turn in: Files from ex00 + ScavTrap.{h, hpp}, ScavTrap.cpp 

Create a derived class named ScavTrap that inherits from ClapTrap.

    Construction/Destruction: Must show proper chaining (ClapTrap first, then ScavTrap; destruction in reverse).

    Attributes: Hit points (100), Energy points (50), Attack damage (20).

    Special Ability: void guardGate(); displays a message that ScavTrap is in Gatekeeper mode.

Chapter VI: Exercise 02: Repetitive work

    Turn-in directory: ex02/

    Files to turn in: Previous files + FragTrap.{h, hpp}, FragTrap.cpp 

Implement a FragTrap class inheriting from ClapTrap:

    Attributes: Hit points (100), Energy points (100), Attack damage (30).

    Special Ability: void highFivesGuys(void); displays a positive high-five request.

    Must also show proper construction/destruction chaining with unique messages.

Chapter VII: Exercise 03: Now it’s weird!

    Turn-in directory: ex03/

    Files to turn in: Previous files + DiamondTrap.{h, hpp}, DiamondTrap.cpp 

Create a DiamondTrap class that inherits from both FragTrap AND ScavTrap:

    Attributes inherited from:

        Name: Constructor parameter.

        ClapTrap::name: Constructor parameter + "_clap_name" suffix.

        Hit points: FragTrap.

        Energy points: ScavTrap.

        Attack damage: FragTrap.

        attack(): ScavTrap.

    Special Ability: void whoAmI(); displays both its name and its ClapTrap name.

    The ClapTrap subobject must be created only once.
